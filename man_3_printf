.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \"main.h\"
.sp
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
produces output according to a format as described below. The function writes to stdout, the standard output stream.

The
.B format
string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not \`%\`) which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character \`%\` and ends with a conversion specifier. The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. 

Supported conversion specifiers are:
.TP
.BR %c 
Prints a single character.
.TP
.BR %s 
Prints a string of characters.
.TP
.BR %d
Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
.TP
.BR %i
Prints an integer in decimal (base 10) format.
.TP
.BR %%
Prints a percent sign.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.B _printf
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
